# Hi, I'm [Your Real Name] (Pandaemo) 👋
### Bachelor of Information Technology (Game Technology) | UTeM '26

I am a final-year student graduating in March 2026. While my degree is in **Game Technology**, I have a strong interest in **Software Engineering**. I enjoy the challenge of writing high-performance code—whether it's optimizing a game loop or building a reliable backend service.

**Motto:**
> "Turning complex logic into reliable software."

## 🚀 Key Projects

### 1. BulkMailSender (Backend Engineering)
*A robust email automation tool designed with enterprise architecture patterns.*

This project was built to solve the problem of handling large-scale email dispatch reliability.
* **The Architecture:** Implemented an asynchronous **Background Job Service** (`IHostedService`) to prevent UI blocking during processing.
* **Reliability:** Features a **retry mechanism** with exponential backoff for failed network requests and graceful cancellation tokens.
* **Performance:** Handles large file attachments via stream processing to minimize memory usage.
* **Tech Stack:** C#, ASP.NET Core Razor Pages, Docker, Bootstrap 5.
