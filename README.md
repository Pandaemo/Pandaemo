## 🚀 Key Projects

### 1. BulkMailSender (Backend Engineering)
*A robust email automation tool designed with enterprise architecture patterns.*

This project was built to solve the problem of handling large-scale email dispatch reliability.
* **The Architecture:** Implemented an asynchronous **Background Job Service** (`IHostedService`) to prevent UI blocking during processing.
* **Reliability:** Features a **retry mechanism** with exponential backoff for failed network requests and graceful cancellation tokens.
* **Performance:** Handles large file attachments via stream processing to minimize memory usage.
* **Tech Stack:** C#, ASP.NET Core Razor Pages, Docker, Bootstrap 5.
* **[View Code on GitHub](https://github.com/Fadhil-8bit/BulkMailSender)**

### 2. SOCConvertor (Document Automation)
*A PDF processing tool engineered to streamline administrative workflows.*

Designed to automate the separation of bulk PDF documents (Invoices, SOAs) into individual files based on content analysis.
* **Core Logic:** Integrated **iText 7** to parse raw PDF text and identify split triggers using Regex pattern matching.
* **Architecture:** Built on **ASP.NET Core MVC (.NET 9)** with a service-oriented approach (`PdfService`) for clean separation of concerns.
* **Security:** Implemented strict path sanitization and validation logic to prevent directory traversal attacks during file handling.
* **Deployment:** Containerized with **Docker** for consistent environment deployment.
* **[View Code on GitHub](https://github.com/Fadhil-8bit/socconverter-alpha)**

### 3. [Your Unity Game Name] (Game Logic)
*A 3D simulation project exploring advanced C# mechanics.*

* **Summary:** A survival prototype featuring procedural generation.
* **My Contribution:** Focused on the **Inventory Data Structure**. I moved away from simple lists and implemented a Dictionary-based system for O(1) item lookup performance.
* **Tech Stack:** Unity (C#), ScriptableObjects.
* **[View Code on GitHub]** (Link to your repo)
