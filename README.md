## 🚀 Featured Projects

My portfolio is divided to showcase my proficiency in both reliable software architecture and creative game technology.

### 1. Software Engineering: BulkMailSender

A production-grade, highly resilient ASP.NET Core Razor Pages application designed for efficient bulk email processing. This project demonstrates strong backend architecture and systems design.

* **Architecture & Robustness:** Implements an asynchronous **Background Job Service** (`IHostedService`) to ensure non-blocking performance. Features a robust **3-attempt retry logic** with exponential backoff for failed emails and includes graceful cancellation support.
* **Key Functionality:** Handles large file processing (ZIP archives up to 500MB) via streaming and features persistent SMTP configuration, recipient CSV validation, and real-time progress tracking.
* **Deployment:** Production-ready Docker containerization with comprehensive setup guides for both HTTP and HTTPS.
* **Technologies:** C#, .NET 10, ASP.NET Core Razor Pages, Bootstrap 5, Docker.
