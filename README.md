## 🚀 Key Projects

### 1. BulkMailSender (Backend Engineering)
*A robust email automation tool designed with enterprise architecture patterns.*

This project was built to solve the problem of handling large-scale email dispatch reliability.
* **The Architecture:** Implemented an asynchronous **Background Job Service** (`IHostedService`) to prevent UI blocking during processing.
* **Reliability:** Features a **retry mechanism** with exponential backoff for failed network requests and graceful cancellation tokens.
* **Performance:** Handles large file attachments via stream processing to minimize memory usage.
* **Tech Stack:** C#, ASP.NET Core Razor Pages, Docker, Bootstrap 5.
